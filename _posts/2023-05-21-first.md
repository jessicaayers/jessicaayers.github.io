## This is my first blog post

## What do you think being a data scientist is about?  
I think being a data scientist is about combining knowledge from different fields, such as statistics, computer science, and field-specific knowledge to answer a specific problem. I think it extends beyond just programming and statistical knowledge.

## What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?  
From the "data science vs data analystics vs machine learning" article, the three major knowledge areas for a data scientist were defined as analytics, programming, and domain knowledge. These three knowledge areas were common across all the data science articles provided. I believe the major duties of a data scientist are being able to apply statistical methods to large amounts of data, and using inference from created models to solve a specific problem/question and implement a solution. My biggest takeaway from the "What is data science vs. statistics?" article was that a data scientist should infer, predict, and deliver. 

## What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?  
The biggest difference I saw between data scientists and statisticians is that data scientists are not as concerned with the underlying statistical basis of a problem, but more so the ability to solve a specific problem. In addition to a strong statistical foundation, data scientists also have to be knowledgable in a specific field. The "What is data science vs statistics?" article spoke about "the question behind the question". Data scientists need more specific knowledge in a field to be able to solve a specific problem that they are presented with. The biggest similarity between data scientists and statisticians is that both rely on having a strong statistical background. Both roles works with statisical methods, models, and programming projects. 

## How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?
I view myself more as a statistician than a data scientist. This is because I love theory and I enjoy doing deep dives into statistical concepts. However, data science is a field that I would really like to explore. I think it would be very interesting to become an expert in a field and be able to focus on solving field-specific questions.
