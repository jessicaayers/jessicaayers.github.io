Once youâ€™ve completed your vignette you should write a brief blog post:

  - explaining what you did in the project and any interesting findings
  - You should also reflect on the process you went through for this project. Discuss things like:
    - what was the most difficult part of the logic and programming for you?
    - what would you do differently in approaching a similar project in the future?
  - In your blog post, provide a link to your github pages repo and the regular repo (non- github pages site) as well! The URL to this (rendered) blog post is what you will submit at the project assignment link.
